# What is the Walking Effect?
The Walking Effect is an application created to make navigating Wellesley’s campus easier for anyone, from students to visitors. Users of the Walking Effect will be able to simply choose two locations on Wellesley’s campus and the Walking Effect will return the shortest route, including directions, distance in miles to that location, and predicted walking time. This route is calculated to find the quickest path between two locations using a java implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm. 

When users open up the Walking Effect Application, they will be greeted by the About page. The Walking Effect contains four tabs in total: About Page, Find Route Page, Add a Location, and Explore. In the About Page, there is a short description of the app, a logo, and information about the creation of the app. In the Find Route Page tab, the application will display the quickest route between two selected locations. In the Add a Location tab, the user can input information about a place on campus not included in the default locations, and after they click “Add Location,” they can use it in the functionality of the Find Route tab. The Explore tab allows the user to choose a location on campus,  read a small blurb about it, and view a picture of the location.


# How to Run the Walking Effect
 
## I. Get Started:
Unzip the walkingeffect folder. Do a quick once-over of the files you just downloaded, 
and make sure all of the below files are there:

### Java Files:				
-AboutPanel.java			
-AddLocationPanel.java		
-ExplorePanel.java			
-FindRoutePanel.java			
-Graph.java
-HomePanel.java
-Location.java
-LocationTestingDriver.java
-Map.java
-ObjectGraph.java
-Path.java
-PathTestingDriver.java
-WalkingEffectGUI.java
-WellesleyMap.java
### Folders:
-javafoundations
 
## II. Run the Program:
After ensuring that all the necessary classes are in the same folder, locate the WalkingEffectGUI.java file. Open the file in your favorite text editor (such as DrJava) and compile it. If you have trouble compiling the file, make sure you are using a compatible compiler (the creators of the Walking Effect used JDK 6.0_6.5 or the Eclipse Compiler to develop this project). If you are still having trouble, contact one of the creators of the Walking Effect.
 
## III. Enjoy:
Now you are ready to go! Run WalkingEffectGUI.java. A beautiful GUI will appear with four tabs at the top of the window. Read the information in the About panel to introduce yourself to the app. Browse through the tabs at your leisure. Make sure to add your favorite outdoor study spot (such as the botanical gardens) to the map using the Add Location tab. Plan your day by using the Find Route Panel to find the quickest route between two classes. Learn about pre-loaded locations using the Explore tab, and view pictures of locations, in case you get lost on Wellesley’s campus. With the Walking Effect as your guide, you will be able to clearly and efficiently traverse the campus of Wellesley College.
